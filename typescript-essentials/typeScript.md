# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **‚ú® Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/N7USJ9WF?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Based on my personal experience with OOP languages like C, C++, and Java, I find TypeScript to be more convenient than JavaScript. A strict structure helps not only other people but also oneself

2. **‚ú® Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/J6P72DVT?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Declaring variable types not only improves code clarity but also helps programmer catch errors as early as possible. A huge advantage of such practice is that it's one of ways for documenting your code, which helps to understand project structure more deeply and avoid duplicating type-related information throughout the codebase.
3. **‚ú® Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/X2HL97LY?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Interfaces provide a powerful mechanism for defining code contracts. They allow to connect different parts of a project with each other and make this communication clearer. Also such constructions enhance the readability of program.
4. **‚ú® Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/3XGBSLJH?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Such as previous TypeScript's features, typed functions offer not only faster understanding of your/another programmer work, but also help to avoid stupid and simple mistakes, which would take time to understand in JS. Personally, this feature helps me to understand which functions from a list of already implemented can be reused - I just need to take a glance at function's signature.
5. **‚ú® Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/UFLK6WG3?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Classes are more understandable for people who tried clear OOP languages - it's a powerful mechanism for structuring your code and use such strong OOP principles like encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. TS provides access modifiers, which helps improve code security and maintainability. In collaboration with TS interfaces we ensure that classes implement all necessary properties and methods.
6. **‚ú® Generics in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/ZPX3VM72?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Generics is another powerful feature for making your code simplier and more flexible. It's a perfect way to use only one function / class / interface in different scenarios with different types.Generics reduce the codebase size significantly
7. **‚ú® Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/X2HGRW7Y?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Integrating external libraries into TS projects allows to use existing solutions and enhance the functionality of project. TypeScript's compatibility with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks offers to take advantage of a huge ecosystem of tools and resources.
8. **‚ú® Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/QD7NK8DE?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)  
   **Reflections:** Read about namespaces in TS for the first time and got an understanding of all offered advantages. Also learned the difference between using modules and namespaces

**ü•áFinal achievmentü•á:** Build JS application using TS: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Sofya-7099/N7U5RTZF?sharingId=F74865C3C9CB18D3)
